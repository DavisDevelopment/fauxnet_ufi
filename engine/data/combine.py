def labeledfeatures(eqdata:pd.DataFrame, featurefunc, labelfunc):
    """
    -
      Return features and labels for the given equity data.
      Each row of the features returned contains `2 * n_sessions + 1` columns
      (or 1 less if the constant feature is excluded). After the constant feature,
      if present, there will be `n_sessions` columns derived from daily growth
      of the given price column, which defaults to 'Adj Close'. There will then
      follow another `n_sessions` columns representing current volume as
      a multiple of average volume over the previous 252 (or other value determined
      by the user) sessions. 
      
      The returned features are not centered or normalized because these
      adjustments need to be made after test or cross-validation data has
      been removed.
      The constant feature is prepended by default.
      The labels are derived from `eqdata` using `labelfunc`.
      Parameters
      ----------
      eqdata : DataFrame
         Expected is a dataframe as return by the `get()` function. A column
         labeled 'Volume' must be present.
      featurefunc : function
         Function taking a dataframe of simple equity data as argument
         and returning a dataframe of features and an integer representing
         the number of rows that had to be skipped at the beginning of
         the index of the input dataframe. The rows skipped are used
         to synchronize the indices of features and labels. For example,
         if the features are composed of 4 successive daily returns, then
         the date of row 0 of features would be the same as the date of row 3
         (counting from 0) of input data. So the corresponding `featurefunc`
         would return a dataframe and the value 3.
      labelfunc : function
         function for deriving labels from `eqdata`. `labelfunc` must
         take a single argument: `df`, a dataframe to which `labelfunc` will be applied.
         `labelfunc` should return a dataframe of labels followed by an int
         specifying the number of feature rows to skip at the end of the feature
         dataframe. For example, if features are relative prices 64 days out,
         these features will only be known up until 64 days before the data
         runs out. In order to properly align features and labels, the features
         should not include the last 64 rows that would otherwise be possible.
         Usage:
         `labels, skipatend = labelfunc(eqdata)`
      Returns
      -------
      features : DataFrame
         The features derived from the given parameters.
      labels : DataFrame
         The labels derived from the given parameters.
